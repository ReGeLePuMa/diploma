\section{Status}
\label{sec:status}

The application is implemented up to the binary search analysis stage. There are a few
issues with the dynamic analysis, but they are not critical. The application is able
to minimize quite a few Dockerfiles, but not as many as I would have excepted, possibly
related to the issues with the dynamic analysis.

\section{Planned Work}
\label{sec:planned-work}

The next steps are doing more research on the issues with the dynamic analysis part and then 
implementing the binary search algorithm. With that, all Dockerfiles should be minimized with a 
huge penalty in the resource usage and execution time.
