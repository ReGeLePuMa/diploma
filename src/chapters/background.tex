\section{A brief history of containers}
\label{sec:history}
The idea of containerization is not a new one. The concept has it's roots
since the late 70s, with \textit{chroot}, a Unix command that allows a process to change its root directory,
effectively isolating it from the rest of the system \cite{history-of-containers}, creating
so called \textit{chroot jails}. Over the decades, this concept grew and evolved, with the introduction
of \textit{FreeBSD jails} and \textit{Solaris Zones} around the turn of the millennium adding support for multiple 
isolated environments within the same OS instance \cite{history-of-containers}. 

The next major milestone happened in 2008 with the introduction of \textit{LXC} (Linux Containers),
adding kernel-level support for containers, by leveraging two Linux kernel components: \textit{cgroups}, which
provides ways to group processes in order to better manage resources and \textit{namespaces}, which provide isolation.\cite{history-of-containers}

In 2013, the launch of \textit{Docker} radically changed the landscape of containerization by providing a developer-friendly way to 
create, manage and deploy containers. Docker introduced the concept of container images, files which store the data needed for the container to run, 
\href{https://hub.docker.com/}{\textit{Docker Hub}}, a public repository for sharing container images, and a powerful command-line interface for managing containers \cite{history-of-containers}.
In the years that followed, multiple platforms sprung up such as \textit{Apptainer} and \textit{Podman}, which are both open-source alternatives to Docker, but none of them managed to gain the same level of popularity.
As such, Docker became synonymous with containerization, holding an overwhelming market share of \textit{87.85}\%\cite{docker-market-share} thus cementing
themselves as the de facto standard in the industry.

\section{The anatomy of a container}
\label{sec:anatomy}

As opposed to virtual machines, which run a full operating system on top of a hypervisor, containers share the host operating system and run as isolated processes
making them much more lightweight and efficient by only having to package the application and its dependencies into a so-called container image.
Currently, there are over 10000 container images available on \href{https://hub.docker.com/}{Docker Hub}, ranging from simple \href{https://hub.docker.com/_/hello-world}{\textit{hello-world}} apps, to 
\href{https://hub.docker.com/search?categories=Databases+\%26+Storage}{\textit{databases}} and even full-blown Linux distributions like \href{https://hub.docker.com/_/ubuntu}{\textit{Ubuntu}}.

Now, how do we create our own container image? By creating a \textit{Dockerfile}, a simple text file that contains all the necessary steps to build the image.\\\\

\lstset{language=Dockerfile,caption=Sample Dockerfile,label=lst:ex-dockerfile}
\begin{lstlisting}
FROM python:3.10.0-slim
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
CMD ["python", "adapter.py"]    
\end{lstlisting}

The format of a Dockerfile is quite simple, with each line representing a command that will be executed in order, the specifications for what each command does can be found in the official documentation\footnote[1]{\href{https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/}{https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/}}
As each command is executed, a new layer is applied on top of the previous one, the container image being represented as a stack of these layers. A layer represents a change to the base image layer such as adding or removing files, installing packages or changing environment variables.

\fig[scale=0.25]{src/img/container-as-layers.png}{img:container-as-layers}{Container layers}

All Dockerfiles require a base image, which is specified by the keyword \textit{FROM}.
The base image can be represented by either an existing image, or if you want to create your own, you can use \textit{\textbf{FROM} scratch} to start from an empty filesystem.
Additionally, Docker supports building the container image in multiple stages, by using the \textit{FROM} command multiple times in the same Dockerfile.

\lstset{language=Dockerfile,caption=Sample Multi-stage Dockerfile,label=lst:ex-multi-stage-dockerifle}
\begin{lstlisting}
    FROM alpine:latest AS builder
    RUN apk --no-cache add build-base
    
    FROM builder AS build1
    COPY source1.cpp source.cpp
    RUN g++ -o /binary source.cpp
    
    FROM builder AS build2
    COPY source2.cpp source.cpp
    RUN g++ -o /binary source.cpp   
\end{lstlisting}

This coupled with the \textit{scratch} base image serves as the mechanism that allows for the creation of minimal container images, by defining first a 
builder image and then copying the required files to the empty image.
