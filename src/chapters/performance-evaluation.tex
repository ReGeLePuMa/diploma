In order to evaluate the minimization process, I tried minimizing a wide range of applications, from simple \textit{Hello World} programs to complex 
software like \textit{Wordpress}, \textit{Chromium} and \textit{MariaDB}, summing a sample size of 
38. For each application, I calculated the size reduction of the minimal Docker image obtained by the minimization process compared to the 
original Docker image as well as the stage it reached in the minimization process (\textit{Static Analysis}, \textit{Dynamic Analysis} or \textit{Binary Search\footnote{I chose to limit the steps of the binary search to 3, due to risks of hardware failure }}).
The results are as follows:

The chart above shows that the program was able to correctly minimize applications in all three stages and that the majority of the applications were minimized in the 
\textit{Static Analysis} and \textit{Dynamic Analysis} stages, with only the more complex applications requiring the \textit{Binary Search} stage.

In terms of the size reduction per stage, the results are the following:

As displayed in the chart above, the applications that benefited the most from the minimzation process were those that were able to be minimized in the \textit{Static Analysis} stage, with an average size reduction of 96\%. The applications that required the \textit{Dynamic Analysis} stage had an average size reduction of 80\%, while those that required the \textit{Binary Search} stage had an average size reduction of 17\% ( with 3 iterations ).
The average size reduction across all applications was 70\%, which is a significant improvement over the original Docker images.
For a full breakdown of the size reduction per application, see the chart below:
